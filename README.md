# SVM Classification on Breast Cancer Data
This project demonstrates the implementation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to analyze and predict breast cancer diagnoses using the breast cancer dataset from scikit-learn.

##  SVM
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space, aiming to maximize the margin between classes.

## Overview
In this project, we use the breast cancer dataset to classify tumors as malignant or benign. We apply an SVM classifier to the dataset and visualize the decision boundaries to understand the classification performance.

## Requirements
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. sklearn
4. matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the breast cancer dataset provided by scikit-learn. It includes features related to cell nuclei characteristics, with labels indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.

## Results
The script will output the accuracy of the SVM classifier on the test data and display a plot of the decision boundary along with the training data points. Here, we got an accuracy of 91%.
